A Pomodoro timer that alternates between 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks. Here are the key components of the code:

- **State Management**: The `App` class component manages state with properties like `sessionLength`, `breakLength`, `display`, and `playPause` to control the timer's behavior.
- **Timer Functionality**: The `countdown` method handles the countdown logic, switching between session and break times, and playing an alarm sound when the timer reaches zero.
- **Event Handling**: The `handleClick` method updates the state based on user interactions, such as starting/stopping the timer or resetting it to default values.
- **UI Components**: The code includes SVG icons for pause/play, replay, and arrow buttons, and renders the timer, session, and break length controls.

Overall, the code is structured to provide an interactive timer interface for users to manage their work and break periods effectively. It uses React's stateful components to handle the logic and user interactions.
